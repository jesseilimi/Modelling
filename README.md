### Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain their customer base. By predicting which customers are likely to churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them. This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn based on various features extracted from the dataset.

### Data Description

The dataset provided for this project includes various features related to customer behavior and usage patterns. The target variable is `churn`, indicating whether a customer has churned.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook executed_modeling_notebook.ipynb
    ```

### Notebook Outline

1. **Import Packages**:
   Import necessary libraries and set up the environment.

2. **Load Data**:
   Load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

3. **Preprocess Data**:
   Clean and preprocess the data by removing irrelevant columns and handling categorical variables.

4. **Train Random Forest Classifier**:
   Train a Random Forest Classifier using the preprocessed data.

5. **Evaluate the Model**:
   Evaluate the model using various metrics and visualize the results with a confusion matrix.

6. **Evaluation Metrics Explanation**:
   Provide a detailed explanation of the chosen evaluation metrics and discuss the model's performance.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **ROC AUC**: Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
- **Classification Report**: Provides detailed insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of the classification model in terms of actual versus predicted classes.

### Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using the aforementioned metrics. Based on these metrics, the model performance is satisfactory, but further improvements could be made by fine-tuning the model or engineering additional features.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

To install the required packages, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
